# Notes

- Please open this in the latest IntelliJ IDEA.
- Run jar gradle task to create executable jar
- Please use following command to run jar for your test 
runner ```cat input.txt | java -jar CronParser-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 16:46```

## Given more time available, than improvements would be...
 - extraction and splitting of the logic inside CronOutputFactoryImpl and Main.kt to more files/ classes, that can be unit tested and ready for reuse.
 - splitting logic to simpler classes / methods to follow SOLID principles
